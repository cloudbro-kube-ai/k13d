      In namespace 'privileged-test':
      1. Create a Pod named 'debug-pod' using busybox:1.36 with command "sleep 3600"
      2. Configure the container security context to run in privileged mode:
         - privileged: true
      3. Mount the host's /var/log directory to /host-logs in the container (for log access)
         - Use a hostPath volume named 'host-logs'
      4. Note: This is for debugging purposes only; privileged pods should be avoided in production
