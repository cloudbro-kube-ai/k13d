      In namespace 'deploy-test', there is a deployment 'rolling-app' that is currently rolling out an update.

      1. Pause the rollout of the deployment 'rolling-app'
      2. Verify the deployment rollout is paused

      Pausing a rollout allows you to inspect the deployment state, check logs,
      and ensure everything is working before completing the update.

      After verification, the rollout should remain paused (do not resume it).
