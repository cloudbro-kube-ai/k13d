      A PVC named 'app-data' is in Pending state and cannot bind to the available PV.

      Diagnose the issue and fix it so the PVC can successfully bind to a PV.

      Common issues to check:
      - Access mode mismatch
      - Storage class mismatch
      - Capacity mismatch
      - Selector/label mismatch

      The solution should result in the PVC being Bound.
