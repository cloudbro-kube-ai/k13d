name: Create ExternalName Service
description: Create an ExternalName service that maps to an external DNS name

      Create a service named 'external-db' in namespace 'service-test' with:

      1. type: ExternalName
      2. externalName: database.example.com

      ExternalName services map a service to a DNS name rather than to pods.
      When a client connects to this service, the DNS name resolves to the
      external hostname, allowing pods to access external services through
      Kubernetes service discovery.

      Verify the service is created with the correct ExternalName configuration.
