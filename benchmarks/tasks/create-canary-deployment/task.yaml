Can you deploy it as a canary (as engine-v2-1)? We want about 50% of traffic to go to the new version. The current deployment is named engine-v2-0 in the canary-deployment-ns namespace and uses nginx:1.28. Create a new deployment engine-v2-1 with nginx:1.29 and update the service selector to route traffic to both versions."
