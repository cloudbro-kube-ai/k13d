# Contributing to k13d

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **k13d**! It's people like you who make k13d such a great tool.

## 🌟 Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork** locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cloudbro-kube-ai/k13d.git
    cd k13d
    ```
3.  **Set up the development environment**:
    - Ensure you have Go 1.25+ installed.
    - Run `go mod download`.
4.  **Create a branch from `dev`** for your changes:
    ```bash
    git checkout dev
    git pull origin dev
    git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
    ```

## 🌿 Branch Strategy

We use a simple branch strategy based on `dev`:

```
main        ← Production releases only
  │
  └── dev   ← Development branch (default for PRs)
       │
       ├── feature/xxx   ← New features
       ├── fix/xxx       ← Bug fixes
       ├── docs/xxx      ← Documentation
       └── refactor/xxx  ← Code refactoring
```

### Branch Rules

| Branch | Purpose | Merge Target |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `main` | Production releases | - |
| `dev` | Development integration | `main` (release) |
| `feature/*` | New features | `dev` |
| `fix/*` | Bug fixes | `dev` |
| `docs/*` | Documentation | `dev` |
| `refactor/*` | Code refactoring | `dev` |

### Workflow

1. **Always branch from `dev`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

2. **Submit PR to `dev`** (not `main`)

3. **After PR merge**: Maintainers will merge `dev` → `main` for releases

## 🛠 Development Workflow

### Coding Standards
- **Go Style**: We strictly follow standard Go formatting. Run `gofmt -s -w .` before committing.
- **Pre-commit**: Install hooks with `pre-commit install`. Commits will run `go fmt ./...` automatically.
- **Linting**: We use `golangci-lint`. Please ensure your code passes all lints.
- **Documentation**: All exported functions, types, and constants must have descriptive comments.
- **Commit Messages**: We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `refactor:` for code restructuring

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Always add unit tests for new logic in `pkg/`.
- **Integration Tests**: For complex features, consider adding integration tests that mock the Kubernetes API.
- **Run Tests**:
  ```bash
  go test ./...
  ```

## 📥 Pull Request Process

1.  **Update Documentation**: If you add a new feature or change an existing one, update the `README.md` or files in `docs/`.
2.  **Self-Review**: Review your own code for any obvious issues or optimizations.
3.  **Submit PR**: Fill out the PR template completely.
4.  **Wait for Review**: Maintainers will review your PR and may suggest changes.

## 🐞 Reporting Bugs

- Use the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/cloudbro-kube-ai/k13d/issues).
- Provide a clear summary and steps to reproduce.
- Include your OS, Go version, and Kubernetes version.

## 💡 Feature Requests

- Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub Issues.
- Describe the "why" behind the feature and how it benefits the community.
